background: know about of Electron, some experience of develop, computer and application.

## The first step
1.go to the github to search wechat api lib
2.search 'wechat api js'
3.search 'node wechat'
4.go to the google to search 'wechat js api' and 'wechat api node'

When I begin to search wechat lib, I am confused which lib is best to use.But when I continue my search, I realize it is just your feat.

As I searching the libs, at the begin, I think many libs seem can be use, I stared some libs, then I realized I can pick the lib with the most stars.

On the process, I find 'Wechat js SDK', It has to many infomation to disturb me, 'Is it useful?'. I looked the things on the website with my patience, finally, I find it is just a util lib which is convenient to let developer to use some function which are in wechat app. So I stopped.

Then, with more info came into my brain, I finally find two libs, electron-wechat and wechaty, to help me.

In this journey, I realized, 'Don't be afraid, just start the first step, you will find the way out'
